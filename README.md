# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Firebase's asynchronous operations and provides a solution.

## The Problem
Attempting to access document snapshot data before it has fully loaded results in an error. This typically occurs when using asynchronous functions without proper error handling.

## The Solution
The solution involves ensuring the data has completely loaded before accessing its properties. This can be achieved using `.then()` to handle promises or async/await.
